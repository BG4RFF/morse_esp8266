# morse_esp8266
This is the esp8266 portion of my morseduino project.

This project was designed to be an educational experience for myself.

My original goals were: Learn how to program an Esp8266 chip. Establish the groundwork for an expandable sensor network. Establish a basic bi-directional communication platform.

This is the ESP8266 portion of this project.
