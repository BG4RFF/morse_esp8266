SENSOR_DEVICE

user_main.c
	This is the initialization file for the user application.
	user_init() is the function that will be called by the framework to execute the user defined application.

user_config.h
	This starts with defining parameters for the demo.  Some of these need to be cleared out.

user_webserver.c
	This file contains the parsing instructions for paramters passed via HTTP requests.
	This file needs to be cleaned up to remove parameters for demo examples that I will not be using.
